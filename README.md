### ( This is a work in progress - use at your own risk )

## Overview

This is a general purpose bot where the primary intention is to enable server owners, as well as third parties to create a bot that is tailored to their specific need or uses cases. The bot is designed to be modular. You can add new features and functionality without the need to modify the core codebase or you can create your own bot using this as a framework.

## Features

This is the main project, the core functionality is divided into git submodules:

- [bot](https://github.com/xN4P4LM-org/bot-o-cat_bot) - The discord bot portion of the project using [Python3](https:// and [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).
- [api](https://github.com/xN4P4LM-org/bot-o-cat_api) - The API portion of the project using Golang and the [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) framework.
- [web](https://github.com/xN4P4LM-org/bot-o-cat_web) - The web portion of the project, it is currently not implemented.
